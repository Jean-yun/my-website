	<h1>Diary</h1>
	I didnâ€™t want to be a part of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190316211038/https://code.likeagirl.io/i-love-coding-but-i-almost-missed-out-cdf77fb7f78f?gi=6f6b46033af2">program</a> in which many students held biases against certain groups and their ability to succeed. Despite this, I decided to make the switch and apply to the program anyway. To my surprise, those guys who made me feel inadequate were not accepted into the program. My perception was that only a selected few of women would make great programmers rather, the people who made me feel this way did so because of their own insecurities; they took out their frustration on women who could do a better job than them. Although nervous to continue, my experience as a second year student has been very positive.
