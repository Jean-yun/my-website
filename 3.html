	<br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/" target="_blank" title="imdb website">Movie Up Synopsis</a> : 
	Ten-year-old Carl Fredricksen idolizes famed explorer Charles Muntz, who was discredited when a giant bird skeleton he brought back from Paradise Falls in South America is deemed a fake. Muntz travels back to the Falls, vowing to not return until he can bring back a live specimen. Carl befriends Ellie, another fan of Muntz, who keeps a scrapbook of her adventures and dreams of moving her "clubhouse" (an abandoned home) to Paradise Falls. Carl and Ellie eventually marry, move into and renovate the clubhouse, and take jobs at the city zoo as a balloon salesman and zookeeper, respectively. After Ellie suffers a miscarriage,[2] the couple decide to save for a trip to Paradise Falls but must repeatedly spend the money on more pressing needs. Years later, Carl decides to surprise Ellie with tickets to Paradise Falls, but she falls ill and is hospitalized. Ellie gives Carl her scrapbook before she dies.
